# LiveKit Examples

**[Spatial Audio](https://github.com/livekit-examples/spatial-audio)**: Users join a 2D world and hear other users' audio in stereo, based on their relative position and distance.

**[Livestream](https://github.com/livekit-examples/livestream)**: Broadcaster streams via RTMP (eg, via OBS). Other users can view their stream and chat.
